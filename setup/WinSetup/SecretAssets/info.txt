To prevent exposing some files to non-owners of the game, the files in this directory are encrypted using a secret passphrase. These files are essentially large github actions secrets.

See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#limits-for-secrets

When one of these files updates, the file needs to be pushed to the repo by someone with the passphrase.

These files are used by github actions in the main branch. Someone could make use of Github Actions on a fork by pushing their own versions of the files from their own copy of the game and setting their own SETUP_ASSETS_PASSPHRASE secret on their fork:
